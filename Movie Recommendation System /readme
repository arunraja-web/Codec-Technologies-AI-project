This project builds a recommendation engine that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. By analyzing user ratings, genres, and similarities between movies, the system predicts what movies a user is most likely to enjoy. Recommendation systems are widely used in platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and YouTube, making this project highly practical and industry‑relevant.
